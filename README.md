## Hi there 👋

I like making small contributions to the Minecraft community.

### My notable creations
* Matject : A smart TUI script to replace .material.bin files of Minecraft Bedrock Edition (GDK builds partially supported)
* OreUI Utilities : Some unhides some hidden Minecraft Bedrock features, I only do packaging and maintenance
* BRD Updater Script : Script to keep BetterRenderDragon updated and one click open BRD
* MB Loader Jetpack : MB Loader app rewrite in Kotlin + Jetpack Compose with added functionality
